# GHIBLI CALCULATOR

My own calculator from scratch! Inspired by Studio Ghibli's aesthetic.

**Link to project:** https://davidwiese.github.io/calculator/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Accomplished the design and logic with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Optimizations

I'd like to fix a few bugs that can occur if someone is using the calculator in a non-conventional way. Would also like to create a responsive mobile version.

## Lessons Learned:

Calculators are hard. Major props to Texas Instruments.

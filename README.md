# GHIBLI CALCULATOR

My own calculator from scratch! Inspired by Studio Ghibli's work.

**Link to project:** Coming soon

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Accomplished the design and logic with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Optimizations

I'd like to fix a few bugs that can occur if someone is using the calculator in a non-conventional way. Would also like to create a mobile responsive version.

## Lessons Learned:

Calculators are hard.
